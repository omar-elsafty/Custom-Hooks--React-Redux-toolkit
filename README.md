# Custom-Hooks--React-Redux-toolkit

My Custom Hooks for calling Api ,make slices and entity adapter in redux toolkit and form validation to reduce redundancy

1- use Api :: for making axios call

    Inputs : (api end point for entity)   // ex :"city"
    Outputs : object contains four methods { getAll, getById, save, remove }
             each of them  accepts another specific apiEndPoinr and the values for its logic

# ====================================================

2- useSlice :: for making slice in entity adapter in redux toolkit

    Inputs : 1-apiEndPoint : for entity (it will pass it for useApi) to retrieve four methods

             2-name : for naming the actions which generated by it (recommended to be the same name in the reducer )

    Outputs : object contains the selectors and the AsyncThunk methods for calling Api
              and the entity adabter and slice for generate your extra selectors
        const{
        fetchAll,
        save,
        remove,
        entityAdapter,
        slice,
        selectAll,
        selectById,
        selectStatus,
        }=useSlice("ApiEndPoint",'Actionsname');

====================================================

3- useForm : for making form logic for valodation and submitting form

    Inputs:
            1-callback function for calling in submition if form is valid
            2-schema for validate inputs (I use joi in this case)
            3-Intial values for generate form with intial values (Put action) or empty object

    Outputs : Object contains two methods and two objects
    {
        handleChange,
        handleSubmit,
        values,
        errors,
    }
    1-handle change to give it for each input.
    2-handle submit for submitting the form.
    3-values to give it for each input with it's name.
    4-errors to give it for each input with it's name.
